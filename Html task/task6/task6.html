            Popularly known as the ‘Father of the Digital World’, Steve Jobs an
            American entrepreneur, investor, co-founder of Apple Inc. Not the
            one to be satisfied with a single achievement, he moved on to make
            history in the world of consumer electronics with his foray into the
            music and cellular industry. The founder of Apple Inc, Pixar
            Animation Studios and NeXT Inc, Jobs gave information technology its
            life and blood. A master of innovation, he was known for his
            perfectionist attitude and futuristic vision. He foresaw trend in
            the field of information technology and worked hard to embrace the
            same in his line of products. With about 346 US patents by his side,
            Steve Jobs created a revolution in his field with his novel ideas
            and unique concepts. During his years at the Apple, he administered
            the development of the iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He was
            the mastermind behind the working of the company's Apple Retail
            Stores, iTunes Store and the App Store. Interestingly, with so much
            to fall back upon, it is quite amusing to know that this legendary
            innovator was not much educated, in fact a college dropout.

        <h2>Childhood and Early Life</h2>
        <div>
            Born on February 24, 1955, Steve Paul Jobs was the adopted son of
            Paul Reinhold and Clara Jobs. His biological parents were
            Abdulfattah ‘John’ Jandali and Joanne Carole Schieble, who could not
            raise Steve, as their parents objected to their relationship.
        </div>
        <div>
            Ever since a young age, Jobs was exposed to the world of mechanics.
            He would spent long hours with his father, dismantling and
            rebuilding electronic devices in the family garage. It was these
            experiences that gave the little boy tenacity and mechanical
            prowess.

            Academically, after passing his high school in 1972, he enrolled at
            the Reed College but dropped out of the same in a time frame of six
            months to pursue creative classes, including a course on
            calligraphy.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>His first move professionally was that of a technician at
                    Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, in 1973. In mid-1974,
                    Jobs went to India to meet Neem Karoli Baba for spiritual
                    enlightenment. Before he could meet Neem Karoli Baba, the
                    Baba died and after a brief hiatus of about seven months,
                    Jobs returned to Atari to create a circuit board for the
                    arcade video game Breakout.</li>
                <li>Along with Wozniak, he developed a circuit board eliminating
                    about 50 chips from the machine thereby making the same
                    compact. Next was the development of the digital ‘blue box’,
                    which allowed free-long distance calls. It was the positive
                    response of the blue box that instilled in him the need to
                    make it big in electronics</li>
                <li>In 1976, along with Wozniak, he founded ‘Apple Computer
                    Company’. Initially, the company mainly aimed at selling
                    circuit boards. Same year, Wozniak invented the Apple I
                    computer. </li>

                    Lisa as his child.</li>
                <li>He tied the knot with Laurene Powell on March 18, 1991. The
