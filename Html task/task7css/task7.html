            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p id="sam">Sam Rubik</p>
            <div>JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the
                ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often
                just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
                syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                first-class functions.</div>
            <div>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables
                interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
                applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
                client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a
                dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</div>
            <div>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
                functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
                dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
                Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does
                not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage,
                or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web
                browser) provides those APIs.</div>
            <div>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers,
                but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js.
                They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with
                frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.</div>
            <div>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java,
                including language name, syntax, and respective standard
                libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in
                design.</div>
